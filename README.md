# Portfolio Repository

This repository contains several project showing my programming skills in Python. 
Each project address a specific skill, listed below (sorted from the easiest to the most difficult):

- *U.S. Medical Insurance project*: **DataFrame manipulation** with `Pandas`
- *Life Expectancy and GD*P: **Showing results** with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- *Biodiversity*: **Data Analysis**
- *Titanic*: **EDA, Feature engineering and Machine Learning** application with `Scikit-learn`

Some other projects are working in progress, such as:

- OK Cupid Date-a-Scientist: EDA, Feature engineering and Machine Learning application with `Scikit-learn`
- Titanic: add a Deep Learning approach using TensorFlow and Keras

The number of project in this repository will constantly increase, hopefully adding projects with a growing level of difficulty, so keep an eye on it.
