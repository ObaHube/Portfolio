# Portfolio Repository

This repository contains several project showing my programming skills in Python. 
Each project address specific skills, listed below (sorted from the easiest to the most difficult):

- *U.S. Medical Insurance project*: **DataFrame manipulation** with `Pandas`
- *Life Expectancy and GD*P: **Showing results** with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- *Biodiversity*: **Data Analysis**
- *Titanic*: **EDA, Feature engineering and Machine Learning** application with `Scikit-learn`
- *Forest Cover Type classification*: **EDA, Feature engineering and Deep Learning** application with 'Tensorflow' and 'Keras'

Apart from the skills, the projects address some very different and interesting topics, whose description can be retrieved inside the project files. Check them if you want to explore those arguments.

Some other projects are working in progress, such as:

- OK Cupid Date-a-Scientist: EDA, Feature engineering and Machine Learning application with `Scikit-learn`
- Titanic: add a Deep Learning approach using 'TensorFlow' and 'Keras'

The number of project in this repository will constantly increase, hopefully adding projects with a growing level of difficulty, so keep an eye on it.
